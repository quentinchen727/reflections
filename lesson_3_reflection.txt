When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all in your local computer?
When I want to access my code from anywhere else other my local computer, it will be much more flexible and accessible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Thisw will give me more control on my code base.
