What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository, it will create a hidden git direcotry
including all meta data to help manage the respisotry.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area acts as a cache between working directory and the repository.
It will reduce the number of commit you need, and also other operations.
