How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
 the bug that was introduced?
It can quickly pinpoint the change I made and find out the bug quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make
 you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can choose any version of my work at my will, resulting in great 
flexibility.

Git allows to track multiple files together as some logic part makes sense only with more than one file changed.

How might using uersion control make your more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always revert back to find the culprit and put it back to track.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
for?
It is much more convenient to edit my code and manage it in my repository.

Some useful git commands:
git clone repository_address  #copy repository
git log # list commit history
git log --stat # list statistics
git diff diff1 diff2 # list difference between two diffs
git checkout diff # reverse to diff
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global core.editor "vim -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictsytle diff3
# Besides, 3 config files are git-completion.bash, git-prompt.sh and
# .bash_profile
